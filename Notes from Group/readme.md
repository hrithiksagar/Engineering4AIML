    1. Notes from Group/1. Teaching RAG to ‚ÄúRemember‚Äù_ How MemoRAG Enhances Question-Answering Through Memory _ by Florian June _ Sep, 2024 _ Towards AI.pdf 
        -   An interesting article on MemoRAG, a new approach to retrieval augmented generation
    2. Notes from Group/2. Vector Embeddings Are Lossy. Here‚Äôs What to Do About It. _ by Brian Godsey _ Sep, 2024 _ Towards Data Science.pdf
        -   A very intuitive way of understanding vector embeddings in general, their strengths and weaknesses. One thing that I liked about the article a lot is that they use an actual example instead of just doing theory.
    3. Notes from Group/3. DeepSpeed Under the Hood_ Revolutionising AI with Large-Scale Model Training _ by Srikaran _ Medium.pdf
        -   A brilliant guide on how large scale training works.
    4. Notes from Group/4. Making Deep Learning go Brrrr From First Principles.pdf
        -   A shorter, but much more intuitive guide on how GPU's in general work. A Real Eye Opener, the analogies are üòç
